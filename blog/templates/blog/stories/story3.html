            <h1>The Mongoose and the Farmer’s Wife</h1>
        </div>



        <div class="shadow-lg p-3 mb-5 rounded">
            <br>
            <p class="lead">One day a farmer and his wife were blessed with a son. They decided to get a mongoose as a
                companion for him. A few months later, the couple had to go out, leaving their son at home. While the
                wife was worried about leaving the baby alone, the farmer assured her that the mongoose would look after
                him while they were away.
                <br><br>
                The farmer’s wife returned earlier than her husband and found that the mongoose’s mouth was stained with
                blood. She immediately accused the animal of killing her child, and in a fit of rage threw a heavy box
                at the mongoose. She then rushed in to check on her son, but what she found was a dead snake lying in
                the room while her baby was safe and sound. Seeing this, the farmer’s wife realised that the mongoose
                had actually saved her son’s life. Realising her mistake, she went out to see if the animal was all
                right, but it was too late and the mongoose had breathed its last. She was absolutely heartbroken and
                reproached herself for her actions.
                <br><br>
                This is another Panchatantra tale, and the story is often told to children to teach them how acting in
                haste can have dire consequences.</p>
